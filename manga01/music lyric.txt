(Call) Ohh—haul away, haul away, crew!
(Response) Haul away—ACE is what we do!



Verse 1
We took plain days and made them gold,
RED sails up, brave and bold.
Beautiful work with a fiery flame,
Chill in the storm—we stay the same.



(Call) Ohh—haul away, haul away, crew!
(Response) Haul away—ACE is what we do!



Verse 2
We spoke in English, voice held strong,
Made a few mistakes—still moved along.
Feedback straight but gentle too,
No hard feelings—just cleaner code to push through.



Chorus
Heave-ho—turn the tide,
Normal days to ACE with pride.
Strike the drum, keep tempo tight,
Ship the work by morning light!



Verse 3
Charts like maps on ocean foam,
Docs and tasks to guide us home.
UX and security in the plan,
Estimate by proof—the sailor’s way, the RED crew’s stance.



Chorus
Heave-ho—turn the tide,
Normal days to ACE with pride.
Strike the drum, keep tempo tight,
Ship the work by morning light!



Bridge (The Treasure List)
Sixty percent was yesterday’s lore,
Ninety-eight now—unit tests shore to shore.
E2E rolling like thunder and sea,
Contract tests signed—no leaks in thee!
Old charts tossed, new standards drawn,
ECharts steady from dusk to dawn.
Three to six—our cargo grew,
Reports delivered—clean and true.
Manual approvals? Not anymore—
Auto-flow opened the harbor door.
Wave to RCP, the data runs free,
Like a fast black current under the sea.



Final Chorus
Heave-ho—turn the tide,
Normal days to ACE with pride.
Keep it pro and keep it clear,
Grow that English year by year.
Drop overthinking—let it go,
RED crew sailing—steady, slow… then go!
